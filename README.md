# (A guide to my) Programming Portfolio

Hi! My name is Jack Klingenberg, and I am a sophomore at Boston College, pursuing a Mathematics & Computer Science double major with a minor in Finance. I have been programming both in and outside of school for more than five years, and during this time, I have come to discover that there is no better way to teach oneself than by actually doing.

In the spirit of this (somewhat cliche) realization, I have put together some of my recent work to show off some of the Finance/Data Science/CS topics I am fascinated by. I have primarily centered my projects on machine learning and its uses in various contexts; however, I am also interested in topics including automation, web app design, and open-source intelligence which I hope to incorporate into my portfolio soon!

Below is a list of some of my more recent projects. I have taken the time to try and make all the code as readable as possible, as well as include either thorough documentation (for jupyter notebooks) or a ReadMe that explains the goals and structure of the project. Many more projects will be added as I become more available to put some time into documentation. For any questions, or for access to my full portfolio, just shoot me an email.

> <h3 style="color: color:#028ad9"> Loan Risk Analysis Project </h3>
> Sklearn/Pandas based data analysis and modeling for bank loan data to predict default risk. The dataset for the project came from Kaggle.com and included
> ~500k examples with varying feature consistency. The model was implemented using Sklearn's logistic regression model and was analyzed with ROC, PR, and
> confusion matrix statistics.

> <h3 style="color: color:#028ad9"> Java Perceptron Framework </h3>
> Basic neural network framework written in java for consise creation and training of multilayer perceptrons. All implementation is done from scratch, using the JBLAS linear algebra library. Unlike some of the python projects, this project attempts to leverage OOP to enable readable and understandable code.  
> (still troubleshooting a few JBLAS specific errors)

> <h3 style="color: color:#028ad9"> Multivariate Linear Regression Derivation/Implementation </h3> 
> Mathematical derivation and implementation of the Newton's Method update rule to compute a "line of best fit" for approximating house price. The model is trained on data from an ongoing (as of Feb 2023) regression competition on Kaggle.
