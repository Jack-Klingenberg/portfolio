# (A guide to my) Programming Portfolio

Hi! My name is Jack Klingenberg, and I am a sophomore at Boston College, pursuing a Mathematics & Computer Science double major with a minor in Finance. I have been programming both in and outside of school for more than five years, and during this time, I have come to discover that there is no better way to teach oneself than by actually doing.

In the spirit of this (somewhat cliche) realization, I have put together some of my recent work to show off some of the Finance/Data Science/CS topics I am fascinated by. I have primarily centered my projects on machine learning and its uses in various contexts; however, I am also interested in topics including automation, web app design, and open-source intelligence which I hope to incorporate into my portfolio soon!
