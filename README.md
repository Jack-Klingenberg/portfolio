# (A guide to my) Programming Portfolio

Hi! My name is Jack Klingenberg, and I am a sophomore at Boston College, pursuing a Mathematics & Computer Science double major with a minor in Finance. I have been programming both in and outside of school for more than five years, and during this time, I have come to discover that there is no better way to teach oneself than by actually doing.

In the spirit of this (somewhat cliche) realization, I have put together some of my recent work to show off some of the Finance/Data Science/CS topics I am fascinated by. I have primarily centered my projects on machine learning and its uses in various contexts; however, I am also interested in topics including automation, web app design, and open-source intelligence which I hope to incorporate into my portfolio soon!

Below is a list of some of my more recent projects. I have taken the time to try and make all the code as readable as possible, as well as include either thorough documentation (for jupyter notebooks) or a ReadMe that explains the goals and structure of the project. Many more projects will be added as I become more available to put some time into documentation. For any questions, please shoot me by email.
